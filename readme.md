Hello and thank you for looking into my first Python Project.

1. Purpose of the app:

    a. This app allows a user to type in a city name and receive current weather information. The app returns
       the degrees in farhenheit, celcius, and returns whether it's cloudy or not. Over 200,000 cities are able to be found.
          - Note: I will be adding additional features the app returns.

    b. I created the app to help me understand how an API functions and how they are put to use in larger 
       applications.

    c. I enjoy what this app does as I locate cities I plan on travelling to at some point in the future.
